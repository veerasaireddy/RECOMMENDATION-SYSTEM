üìÑ Task 4: Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering
üîç Introduction
As part of the CodTech Machine Learning Internship, Task 4 involves building a Recommendation System using collaborative filtering or matrix factorization techniques. Recommendation systems have become essential in the digital age, powering personalized content on platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify. This task provides valuable hands-on experience in designing systems that can suggest items to users based on patterns in historical data.

The main objective of this task is to build a recommendation model that can suggest items to users based on the behavior of other similar users (user-based collaborative filtering) or based on item similarities (item-based collaborative filtering). These systems are used widely in e-commerce, streaming services, and social platforms to enhance user engagement by offering personalized suggestions.

üéØ Objective
The goal is to create a functional notebook or app that demonstrates:

A recommendation system based on collaborative filtering logic.

A clear output of top-N recommended items for a given user.

Basic performance evaluation or explanation of how the model makes recommendations.

üìö Dataset
To illustrate the logic of a recommendation system, a sample dataset was created consisting of a few users who rated a set of items. The data was structured with three key columns: user, item, and rating. This small dataset mimicked a real-world scenario where users interact with products or services and leave feedback in the form of ratings. While the dataset used was small for demonstration purposes, the implementation can easily be scaled to large datasets like MovieLens or Amazon Reviews.

üß± Data Preparation
The data was transformed into a User-Item Matrix, where rows represented users, columns represented items, and the matrix values were ratings. Missing ratings were filled with zeros, which assumes that no interaction occurred between the user and item. This matrix is the foundation of collaborative filtering, allowing us to compute similarity between users based on their rating vectors.

üîó Collaborative Filtering
The system employed User-Based Collaborative Filtering, where we calculate the similarity between users using cosine similarity. Cosine similarity measures the angle between two users‚Äô rating vectors ‚Äî a higher similarity means more aligned preferences.

After computing the similarity matrix, we selected the top similar users for the target user. Their ratings were aggregated (weighted by similarity scores) to generate a list of recommendations for items the target user had not interacted with yet. These items were then sorted by score, and the top N were presented as recommendations.

For example, if User D had only rated one item, the model analyzed other users who rated similar items and used their preferences to predict what else User D might like. This way, the system generated personalized suggestions without knowing the actual content of the items ‚Äî purely based on collective behavior.

üìà Evaluation and Output
While the small dataset limits traditional evaluation metrics like RMSE or precision@k, the recommendation function output clearly displayed the top recommended items for a specific user. For larger datasets, evaluation can be improved using data splitting and libraries like Surprise or LightFM, which support matrix factorization and advanced collaborative filtering methods.

The recommendation results were interpretable and accurate for the limited dataset. For instance, the system correctly identified that if a user liked Item2 and Item3, they might also like Item1 ‚Äî based on what similar users rated highly.

‚úÖ Final Deliverable
The final deliverable for Task 4 is a Jupyter Notebook titled task4_recommendation_system.ipynb. It contains:

A sample dataset

A pivoted user-item matrix

Cosine similarity computation

A custom recommendation function

Sample results for user recommendations

The notebook is well-commented and structured in a modular way so it can be extended with real-world datasets or additional features like item-based recommendations or matrix factorization using SVD.

üßæ Conclusion
Task 4 was a valuable exercise in building practical recommendation systems using collaborative filtering. It introduced key concepts such as user-item interactions, similarity computation, and predictive recommendation generation. This task not only demonstrated how platforms like Netflix or Amazon personalize content but also laid the groundwork for implementing advanced recommendation techniques. With minimal data and logic, the system produced interpretable and relevant recommendations ‚Äî a foundational component in real-world machine learning systems.
